As the mobile application is build on Phonegap, it will be working on android/iOS and also on mobile web.

As we have 2 phones and 5 resources, I will advice my team members to use web browsers on desktop/laptop and minimize their window to that of the required phone window size. The functionalities of the application should be working on the mobile web as web. 
In this manner, we will be testing the functionalities which are common for both on android and ios on Desktop/Laptop browsers.
Apart from that we will be testing the OS specific specialities on the Mobile devices.
